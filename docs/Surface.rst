   Returns a curve that interpolates points on a surface. The interpolant lies on the surface.

   :param System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<Point2d> points: List of at least two UV parameter locations on the surface.
   :param float tolerance: Tolerance used for the fit of the push-up curve. Generally, the resulting interpolating curve will be within tolerance of the surface.

   :param int closedSurfaceHandling: If 0, all points must be in the rectangular domain of the surface. If the surface is closed in some direction, \
      then this routine will interpret each point and place it at an appropriate location in the covering space. \
      This is the simplest option and should give good results. \
      If 1, then more options for more control of handling curves going across seams are available. \
      If the surface is closed in some direction, then the points are taken as points in the covering space. \
      Example, if srf.IsClosed(0)=True and srf.IsClosed(1)=False and srf.Domain(0)=srf.Domain(1)=Interval(0,1) \
      then if closedSurfaceHandling=1 a point(u, v) in points can have any value for the u coordinate, but must have 0<=v<=1. \
      In particular, if points = { (0.0,0.5), (2.0,0.5) } then the interpolating curve will wrap around the surface two times in the closed direction before ending at start of the curve. \
      If closed=True the last point should equal the first point plus an integer multiple of the period on a closed direction.
