   of points on the surface, each with a corresponding parameter value.

   :param rhino3dm.Surface surface: The surface on which the curve is constructed. The surface should be G1 continuous. \

      function will construct point sequences that cross over the seam.
   :param list[rhino3dm.Point2d] fixedPoints: Surface points to interpolate given by parameters. These must be distinct.
   :param float tolerance: Relative tolerance used by the solver. When in doubt, use a tolerance of 0.0.

      The number of output points is approximately: 2 ^ (level-1) * initCount * fixedPoints.Count.
